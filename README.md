# WORKDAY SCHEDULER

## Overview
In this application I implement the use of some common third party API's. Using Jquery as a wrapper, the many built in methods in our Javascript language are even more versatile and extends simplicity when attempting to construct logic on a front end application. Our Bootstrap library assist us in removing the necessity to cook a lot of CSS styles from scratch. DayJS aids in offering simple methods for manipulation to data related to dates & times. The many libraries available in todays world of development certainly offer a vast amount of tools to aid any developer, no matter what their goal seems to be.
